ENABLE SECURITY HUB

AWS Security Hub gives you a comprehensive view of your high-priority security alerts and compliance status across AWS accounts. 
There is a range of powerful security tools at your disposal, from firewalls and endpoint protection to vulnerability and compliance scanners. 
But oftentimes this leaves your team switching back-and-forth between these tools to deal with hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of security alerts every day. 
With Security Hub, you now have a single place that aggregates, organizes, and prioritizes your security alerts, or findings, from multiple AWS services, 
such as Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, and Amazon Macie, as well as from AWS Partner solutions. Your findings are visually summarized on integrated dashboards with actionable graphs and tables. 
You can also continuously monitor your environment using automated compliance checks based on the AWS best practices and industry standards your organization follows. 
Get started with AWS Security Hub in just a few clicks in the Management Console and once enabled, Security Hub will begin aggregating and prioritizing findings.
